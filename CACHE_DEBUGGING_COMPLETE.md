# Complete Cache Debugging - Enhanced Logging

## New Logging Added

I've added comprehensive logging to track the entire cache lifecycle:

### 1. EnhancedApi Mutations (POST/DELETE/PUT)
Shows when mutations are made and if cache invalidation is requested:
```javascript
[EnhancedApi] 📤 POST /favorites (will invalidate: favorites)
[EnhancedApi] 🗑️ DELETE /favorites/acad (will invalidate: favorites)
[EnhancedApi] 📝 PUT /favorites/123 (will invalidate: favorites)
```

### 2. Cache Invalidation Process
Shows the invalidation in action:
```javascript
[EnhancedApi] 🔥 DELETE complete, invalidating cache: ['favorites']
[EnhancedApi] 🔥 Invalidating cache type: favorites
[CacheService] 🗑️ Clearing cache by type: favorites
[CacheService] 📊 Memory cache size before: 5
[CacheService] 🔍 Checking key: favorites:/favorites/user/123, entry.type: favorites
[CacheService] ✅ Match found, will delete: favorites:/favorites/user/123
[CacheService] 🗑️ Deleting 1 entries from memory
[CacheService] ✅ Deleted from memory: favorites:/favorites/user/123
[CacheService] 📊 Memory cache size after: 4
[CacheService] ✅ clearByType('favorites') complete
[EnhancedApi] ✅ Cache type 'favorites' invalidated
```

### 3. GET Request Cache Behavior
Shows if data is served from cache or fetched fresh:
```javascript
[EnhancedApi] 📦 Serving from cache [favorites]: /favorites/user/123
// OR
[EnhancedApi] 🌐 Fetching fresh data [favorites]: /favorites/user/123
[EnhancedApi] ✅ Cached response [favorites]: /favorites/user/123
```

## Test Now

### Step 1: Refresh the page and favorite a park

**You should see:**
```
1. [EnhancedApi] 📤 POST /favorites (will invalidate: favorites)
2. [EnhancedApi] 🔥 POST complete, invalidating cache: ['favorites']
3. [EnhancedApi] 🔥 Invalidating cache type: favorites
4. [CacheService] 🗑️ Clearing cache by type: favorites
5. [CacheService] 🔍 Checking key: favorites:/favorites/user/...
6. [CacheService] ✅ Match found, will delete: ...
7. [CacheService] ✅ Deleted from memory: ...
8. [EnhancedApi] ✅ Cache type 'favorites' invalidated
```

### Step 2: After mutation, auto-refresh happens

**You should see:**
```
[EnhancedApi] 🌐 Fetching fresh data [favorites]: /favorites/user/...  ← Fresh!
[useFavorites] API Response: {count: 29, ...}  ← Correct count!
```

**You should NOT see:**
```
❌ [EnhancedApi] 📦 Serving from cache [favorites]: ...  ← Should NOT see this!
❌ [useFavorites] API Response: {count: 28, ...}  ← Wrong count!
```

## What Each Log Tells Us

### If you see "📦 Serving from cache" after a mutation:
**Problem**: Cache wasn't invalidated
**Check**: Did you see the cache invalidation logs before this?

### If you see "🗑️ Deleting 0 entries from memory":
**Problem**: No cache entries matched the type
**Possible causes**:
- Cache key uses different type than what's being cleared
- Cache was already empty
- Type string doesn't match

### If you see "🔥 Invalidating cache type: X" but still serve from cache:
**Problem**: Cache invalidation ran but didn't match the right keys
**Check**: The cache key format

### If profile stats go 29 → 28:
**Problem**: Auto-refresh is fetching stale data
**Check**: Cache invalidation logs - was the cache actually cleared?

## Expected Complete Flow

### When You Add a Favorite:

```
1. [Mutation] Adding favorite: acad
2. [EnhancedApi] 📤 POST /favorites (will invalidate: favorites)
3. [EnhancedApi] 🔥 POST complete, invalidating cache: ['favorites']
4. [CacheService] 🗑️ Clearing cache by type: favorites
5. [CacheService] ✅ Match found, will delete: favorites:/favorites/user/...
6. [CacheService] ✅ Deleted from memory: ...
7. [WebSocket] Received favorite_added event
8. [Real-Time] Favorite added
9. [Real-Time] Updated favorites count: 29
10. [ProfilePage] Stats recalculated: {favorites: 29}
11. [ProfileStats] Rendering with stats: 29
12. (Auto-refresh triggers)
13. [EnhancedApi] 🌐 Fetching fresh data [favorites]: ...  ← Fresh fetch!
14. [useFavorites] API Response: {count: 29, ...}  ← Correct!
15. [ProfilePage] Stats recalculated: {favorites: 29}  ← Still 29!
```

### When You Remove a Favorite:

```
1. [Mutation] Removing favorite: acad
2. [EnhancedApi] 🗑️ DELETE /favorites/acad (will invalidate: favorites)
3. [EnhancedApi] 🔥 DELETE complete, invalidating cache: ['favorites']
4. [CacheService] 🗑️ Clearing cache by type: favorites
5. [CacheService] ✅ Deleted from memory: favorites:/favorites/user/...
6. [WebSocket] Received favorite_removed event
7. [Real-Time] Favorite removed
8. [Real-Time] Favorites after removal: 28
9. [ProfilePage] Stats recalculated: {favorites: 28}
10. [ProfileStats] Rendering with stats: 28
11. (Auto-refresh triggers)
12. [EnhancedApi] 🌐 Fetching fresh data [favorites]: ...  ← Fresh fetch!
13. [useFavorites] API Response: {count: 28, ...}  ← Correct!
14. [ProfilePage] Stats recalculated: {favorites: 28}  ← Still 28!
```

## What to Report

After testing, please share:

1. ✅ Do you see "[EnhancedApi] 📤 POST" or "🗑️ DELETE" messages?
2. ✅ Do you see "[CacheService] ✅ Match found, will delete"?
3. ✅ How many entries does it say it's deleting?
4. ✅ After invalidation, does the next GET show "📦 Serving from cache" or "🌐 Fetching fresh data"?

The logs will tell us exactly what's happening!
