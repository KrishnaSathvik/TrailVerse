# AI Scope Restriction Implementation

## Overview
Implemented restrictions to limit the AI chat functionality to **only answer travel-related questions**, helping save token usage by preventing the AI from responding to off-topic queries.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated OpenAI Service (`server/src/services/openaiService.js`)
- **Added "Scope Restrictions" section** to system prompt
- **Defines allowed topics**:
  - National Parks, State Parks, and outdoor travel destinations
  - Trip planning, itineraries, and travel logistics
  - Outdoor activities (hiking, camping, photography, wildlife viewing, etc.)
  - Travel preparation, gear, and safety
  - Accommodations, dining, and local amenities near parks
  - Weather, seasons, and best times to visit
  - General travel advice for outdoor and nature-based trips

- **Instructs AI to politely decline non-travel questions** with a redirect message:
  > "I'm specifically designed to help with National Parks and outdoor travel planning. I can help you plan amazing trips, recommend parks, create itineraries, and answer travel-related questions. Is there anything about your next outdoor adventure I can help with?"

### 2. Updated Claude Service (`server/src/services/claudeService.js`)
- Applied the **same scope restrictions** to maintain consistency across AI providers
- Both OpenAI GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet now have identical boundaries

### 3. How It Works
The restrictions are enforced through the **system prompt** which:
1. Clearly defines the AI's scope at the beginning of every conversation
2. Instructs the AI to politely refuse off-topic questions
3. Automatically redirects users back to travel-related topics
4. Works with the existing AI learning service that personalizes responses based on user feedback

## Benefits

### 1. **Token Usage Savings**
- Prevents wasted tokens on non-travel queries
- AI won't engage in lengthy conversations about unrelated topics
- More efficient use of API credits

### 2. **Better User Experience**
- Sets clear expectations about what the AI can help with
- Maintains focus on the app's core value proposition
- Professional boundary-setting with friendly redirection

### 3. **Consistent Behavior**
- Same restrictions apply to both OpenAI and Claude
- Works seamlessly with personalized prompts
- Maintains restrictions across all conversation types

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: Travel-Related Questions (Should Work)
```
User: "What are the best trails in Yosemite?"
Expected: AI provides detailed trail recommendations

User: "Help me plan a 3-day trip to Yellowstone"
Expected: AI creates itinerary with activities, lodging suggestions

User: "What should I pack for camping in Grand Canyon?"
Expected: AI provides packing list and preparation advice
```

### Test Case 2: Non-Travel Questions (Should Decline)
```
User: "Write me a Python script"
Expected: Polite decline with redirect to travel topics

User: "What's 2+2?"
Expected: Polite decline with redirect to travel topics

User: "Tell me about the latest tech news"
Expected: Polite decline with redirect to travel topics

User: "Help me with my homework"
Expected: Polite decline with redirect to travel topics
```

### Test Case 3: Borderline Questions
```
User: "What's the weather like in California?"
Expected: Should answer if framed in travel context, may redirect for general weather

User: "Tell me about wildlife"
Expected: Should answer with focus on wildlife viewing in parks

User: "History of national parks"
Expected: Should answer as it relates to park visits and context
```

## Implementation Details

### System Prompt Structure
```
1. Introduction (TrailVerse AI identity)
2. SCOPE RESTRICTIONS (NEW - clearly defined boundaries)
3. Expertise areas
4. Response style guidelines
5. Formatting preferences
6. Context awareness instructions
```

### Key Features
- **Non-intrusive**: Works within existing infrastructure
- **No code changes required** in controllers or frontend
- **Backward compatible**: Doesn't break existing functionality
- **Intelligent filtering**: AI uses judgment for borderline cases
- **Friendly UX**: Polite redirection maintains positive user experience

## Files Modified
1. `/server/src/services/openaiService.js` - Added scope restrictions to system prompt
2. `/server/src/services/claudeService.js` - Added scope restrictions to system prompt

## No Additional Configuration Required
The changes are effective immediately - no environment variables, database migrations, or client-side updates needed.

## Monitoring Suggestions

To track effectiveness, consider monitoring:
1. **Average tokens per conversation** - Should decrease over time
2. **User feedback patterns** - Watch for any negative feedback related to restrictions
3. **Conversation topics** - Log when AI declines questions to understand common off-topic queries
4. **Token cost reduction** - Compare monthly API costs before/after implementation

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

If you want even more control, consider:
1. **Client-side warning**: Show disclaimer in chat UI about AI's scope
2. **Pre-validation**: Check user query against keywords before sending to AI
3. **Analytics dashboard**: Track declined queries and token savings
4. **Custom decline messages**: Tailor redirect messages based on query type
5. **Rate limiting**: Combine with token limits for additional cost control

## Notes

- The AI uses its intelligence to determine if a question is travel-related
- Borderline cases are handled gracefully
- The system prompt is effective but not foolproof - determined users could still get off-topic responses
- For stricter control, consider adding pre-processing validation (see Future Enhancements)

**Status**: âœ… Implemented and Ready for Testing
**Impact**: Medium (reduces token usage, improves focus)
**Risk**: Low (easily reversible, doesn't break existing functionality)
