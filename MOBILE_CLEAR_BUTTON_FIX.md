# ✅ Mobile Clear Button Added to Events Page

## What Was Added

### 🎯 **Problem:**
- Clear button was only available inside the mobile filters modal
- Users had to open the modal to clear filters on mobile
- Poor mobile UX - extra step required to clear filters

### ✅ **Solution:**
- Added Clear button to mobile toolbar that's always visible when filters are active
- Button appears next to the Filters button on mobile screens
- Same functionality as desktop - clears all filters with one tap

## Implementation Details

### 📱 **Mobile Toolbar Layout:**
```jsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-3">
  {/* Mobile Filter Button */}
  <Button onClick={() => setShowFilters(true)} className="sm:hidden">
    Filters {activeFiltersCount > 0 && <span>{activeFiltersCount}</span>}
  </Button>

  {/* Mobile Clear Button - NEW! */}
  {activeFiltersCount > 0 && (
    <Button onClick={clearAllFilters} className="sm:hidden">
      Clear
    </Button>
  )}
</div>
```

### 🎨 **Button Styling:**
- **Variant:** `ghost` - subtle styling that doesn't compete with Filters button
- **Size:** `sm` - appropriate size for mobile toolbar
- **Icon:** `X` - clear visual indicator for clearing action
- **Visibility:** Only shows when `activeFiltersCount > 0`

### 📐 **Responsive Behavior:**
- **Mobile (`sm:hidden`)**: Clear button visible in toolbar
- **Desktop (`hidden sm:flex`)**: Uses existing desktop Clear button
- **Consistent**: Same `clearAllFilters` function for both mobile and desktop

## User Experience Improvements

### ✅ **Before:**
1. User applies filters
2. User wants to clear filters
3. User must tap "Filters" button
4. User must open modal
5. User must tap "Clear All" button in modal
6. User must tap "Apply" to close modal

### ✅ **After:**
1. User applies filters
2. User wants to clear filters
3. User taps "Clear" button in toolbar
4. **Done!** ✨
