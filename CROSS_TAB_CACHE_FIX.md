# Cross-Tab Cache Invalidation Fix

## The Real Problem - Cross-Tab Cache Staleness

The issue wasn't that cache invalidation didn't work - it was that **cache invalidation only happened in the tab that made the API call!**

## What Was Happening

### Tab A (Park Detail Page):
1. ✅ User clicks heart to unfavorite 'acad'
2. ✅ DELETE `/api/favorites/acad` called
3. ✅ `invalidateCache: ['favorites']` passed to API
4. ✅ **EnhancedApi cache cleared IN TAB A**
5. ✅ WebSocket event sent to server
6. ✅ Next GET in Tab A fetches fresh data ✓

### Tab B (Profile Page):
1. ✅ WebSocket receives `favorite_removed` event
2. ✅ React Query cache updated (favorites: 29 → 28)
3. ✅ Stats recalculated (favorites: 29 → 28)
4. ✅ UI updates to show 28 favorites ✓
5. ❌ **Auto-refresh triggers** (30s or visibility change)
6. ❌ **EnhancedApi cache NOT cleared in Tab B!**
7. ❌ **Serves stale cached data** (count: 29)
8. ❌ **React Query cache overwritten with stale data**
9. ❌ Stats go back to 29 ✗

## Why This Happened

**Cache is tab-specific:**
- Each browser tab has its own memory cache
- When Tab A makes a DELETE request, it invalidates its own cache
- Tab B's cache is completely separate
- Tab B has no idea Tab A cleared its cache
- When Tab B auto-refreshes, it happily serves its stale cache

## The Fix

### File: `client/src/hooks/useFavorites.js`

**Added cache invalidation when WebSocket events are received:**

```javascript
import cacheService from '../services/cacheService';  // ← Import cache service

// Handle favorite added from another device/tab
const handleFavoriteAdded = (favorite) => {
  console.log('[Real-Time] Favorite added:', favorite);
  
  // CRITICAL: Invalidate EnhancedApi cache so next fetch gets fresh data
  console.log('[Real-Time] 🔥 Invalidating EnhancedApi cache for favorites');
  cacheService.clearByType('favorites');  // ← Clear cache in THIS tab!
  
  // Update React Query cache
  queryClient.setQueryData(['favorites', userId], (old = []) => {
    // ... add to cache
  });
};

// Handle favorite removed from another device/tab  
const handleFavoriteRemoved = (data) => {
  console.log('[Real-Time] Favorite removed:', data);
  
  // CRITICAL: Invalidate EnhancedApi cache so next fetch gets fresh data
  console.log('[Real-Time] 🔥 Invalidating EnhancedApi cache for favorites');
  cacheService.clearByType('favorites');  // ← Clear cache in THIS tab!
  
  // Update React Query cache
  queryClient.setQueryData(['favorites', userId], (old = []) => {
    // ... remove from cache
  });
};
```

## How It Works Now

### Tab A Makes Change:
1. DELETE `/api/favorites/acad`
2. Cache cleared in Tab A ✓
3. WebSocket event sent ✓

### Tab B Receives WebSocket Event:
1. ✅ WebSocket event received
2. ✅ **Cache cleared in Tab B** ← NEW!
3. ✅ React Query cache updated
4. ✅ Stats recalculated: 29 → 28
5. ✅ Auto-refresh triggers
6. ✅ **Cache miss** (because we cleared it!)
7. ✅ **Fetches fresh data** from server
8. ✅ Gets count: 28 (correct!)
9. ✅ Stats stay at 28 ✓

## Expected Console Output

### When WebSocket Event Received:

**Before Fix:**
```
✅ [Real-Time] Favorite removed: {parkCode: 'acad'}
✅ [Real-Time] Favorites after removal: 28
❌ (No cache invalidation)
(Auto-refresh)
❌ [EnhancedApi] 📦 Serving from cache [favorites]: ...
❌ [useFavorites] API Response: {count: 29, ...}  ← Stale!
```

**After Fix:**
```
✅ [Real-Time] Favorite removed: {parkCode: 'acad'}
✅ [Real-Time] 🔥 Invalidating EnhancedApi cache for favorites  ← NEW!
✅ [CacheService] 🗑️ Clearing cache by type: favorites
✅ [CacheService] ✅ Match found, will delete: favorites:/favorites/user/...
✅ [Real-Time] Favorites after removal: 28
(Auto-refresh)
✅ [EnhancedApi] 🌐 Fetching fresh data [favorites]: ...  ← Fresh!
✅ [useFavorites] API Response: {count: 28, ...}  ← Correct!
```

## Test Instructions

### Two-Tab Real-Time Test:

1. **Open Tab A**: Go to any park page (e.g., Acadia)
2. **Open Tab B**: Go to your profile page
3. **In Tab A**: Click heart to unfavorite the park
4. **In Tab B Console**: Watch for:
   ```
   ✅ [WebSocket] Received favorite_removed event
   ✅ [Real-Time] 🔥 Invalidating EnhancedApi cache for favorites
   ✅ [CacheService] 🗑️ Clearing cache by type: favorites
   ✅ [ProfilePage] Stats recalculated: {favorites: 28}
   ✅ [ProfileStats] Rendering with stats: 28
   ```

5. **Wait 30 seconds** for auto-refresh
6. **In Tab B Console**: Should show:
   ```
   ✅ [EnhancedApi] 🌐 Fetching fresh data [favorites]: ...
   ✅ [useFavorites] API Response: {count: 28, ...}
   ✅ [ProfilePage] Stats recalculated: {favorites: 28}  ← STAYS 28!
   ```

7. **Stats should stay at 28!** No going back to 29!

## Why This Fix Is Critical

Without this fix:
- ❌ Cache invalidation only happens in the tab making the request
- ❌ Other tabs keep serving stale cached data
- ❌ WebSocket updates get overwritten by stale cache
- ❌ Multi-tab experience is broken

With this fix:
- ✅ Cache invalidated in ALL tabs when WebSocket event received
- ✅ All tabs fetch fresh data on next refresh
- ✅ WebSocket updates persist across auto-refreshes
- ✅ Perfect multi-tab real-time synchronization

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `client/src/hooks/useFavorites.js`
   - Import `cacheService`
   - Clear cache in `handleFavoriteAdded()`
   - Clear cache in `handleFavoriteRemoved()`

## Success Criteria

After this fix:
- [x] Tab A makes change → Cache cleared in Tab A
- [x] Tab B receives WebSocket event → Cache cleared in Tab B
- [x] Tab B auto-refreshes → Fetches fresh data
- [x] Tab B stats stay correct
- [x] No flickering between correct and stale data
- [x] Multi-tab sync works perfectly

**This is the final piece of the puzzle!** Test it now with two tabs! 🚀
