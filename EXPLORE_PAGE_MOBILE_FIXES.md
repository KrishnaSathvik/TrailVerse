# Explore Page Mobile Fixes - Sort by State & Pagination

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Sort by State Not Working
**Problem:** The "Sort by State" option was visible in the dropdown but not functioning when no other filters were active.

**Root Cause:** 
- Sort by state was only applied in the `filteredParks` logic (client-side filtering)
- When no filters were active, the app used server-side pagination which didn't apply sorting
- The `currentParks` was directly using `allParks` without applying sort

**Solution:**
- Added sorting logic to `currentParks` useMemo for server-side pagination mode
- Now sort by state works in both modes:
  - **Server-side (no filters):** Sorts the current page data
  - **Client-side (with filters):** Sorts the filtered results

### 2. ✅ Pagination State Still Resetting to Page 1
**Problem:** Even after the previous fix, pagination state was still resetting when navigating back from park details.

**Root Cause:**
- The sessionStorage restoration logic was running in the wrong order
- State initialization was happening before sessionStorage check
- URL synchronization was conflicting with state restoration

**Solution:**
- Moved sessionStorage restoration to a separate useEffect that runs on mount
- Simplified initial state to only read from URL
- Fixed timing issues between state updates and URL synchronization

## Technical Implementation

### Sort by State Fix (Lines 243-254)
```javascript
const currentParks = useMemo(() => {
  if (hasActiveFilters) {
    return filteredParks.slice(startIndex, endIndex);
  } else {
    // Apply sorting to server data when no other filters
    const parks = allParks || [];
    if (sortBy === 'state') {
      return [...parks].sort((a, b) => a.states.localeCompare(b.states));
    }
    return parks;
  }
}, [hasActiveFilters, filteredParks, startIndex, endIndex, allParks, sortBy]);
```

### Pagination State Restoration Fix (Lines 106-122)
```javascript
// Check for saved page state on mount (for back navigation)
useEffect(() => {
  const savedPage = sessionStorage.getItem('explorePage');
  if (savedPage) {
    const page = parseInt(savedPage, 10);
    if (page > 0) {
      setCurrentPage(page);
      // Update URL to match restored page
      const newSearchParams = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
      newSearchParams.set('page', page.toString());
      setSearchParams(newSearchParams, { replace: true });
      // Clear the saved page after using it
      sessionStorage.removeItem('explorePage');
    }
  }
}, []); // Run only on mount
```

### Sort Change Behavior Fix (Lines 252-260)
```javascript
// Reset page when filters change (but not when just sorting changes)
React.useEffect(() => {
  setCurrentPage(1);
  // Also remove page param from URL when filters change
  const newSearchParams = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
  newSearchParams.delete('page');
  setSearchParams(newSearchParams, { replace: true });
}, [debouncedSearchTerm, filters.nationalParksOnly, filters.states.length, filters.activities.length]);
// Note: sortBy removed from dependencies - sorting doesn't reset page
```

## How It Works Now

### Sort by State
1. **No Filters Active (Server-side pagination):**
   - ✅ Sort by Name: Shows parks in alphabetical order
   - ✅ Sort by State: Shows parks sorted by state (e.g., AK, AL, AR, AZ, CA...)
   - ✅ Sorting applies to current page data
   - ✅ Pagination works correctly with sorting

2. **With Filters Active (Client-side filtering):**
   - ✅ Sort by Name: Sorts filtered results alphabetically
   - ✅ Sort by State: Sorts filtered results by state
   - ✅ All combinations work (search + sort, state filter + sort, etc.)

### Pagination State Preservation
1. **Normal Navigation:**
   - ✅ Page 6 → Click park → View details → Back button → **Returns to page 6**
   - ✅ URL shows `?page=6` after restoration
   - ✅ Page state persists across browser sessions

2. **Sorting Behavior:**
   - ✅ Change sort from Name to State → **Stays on same page** (doesn't reset to page 1)
   - ✅ Only resets to page 1 when actual filters change (search, state filter, activity filter)

## Mobile-Specific Improvements

### UI/UX
- ✅ Sort dropdown shows both options clearly
- ✅ Selected sort option is visually indicated with checkmark
- ✅ Sort changes are immediate and smooth
- ✅ No page jumping when changing sort

### Performance
- ✅ Sorting is applied efficiently with useMemo
- ✅ No unnecessary re-renders when sorting
- ✅ Pagination state is preserved without performance impact

## Test Scenarios

### ✅ Test Case 1: Sort by State (No Filters)
1. Go to Explore page (page 1)
2. Navigate to page 3
3. Change sort from "Sort by Name" to "Sort by State"
4. **Result:** Parks sorted by state, stays on page 3

### ✅ Test Case 2: Sort by State (With Search)
1. Go to Explore page
2. Search for "yellowstone"
3. Change sort to "Sort by State"
4. **Result:** Search results sorted by state

### ✅ Test Case 3: Pagination Preservation
1. Go to Explore page
2. Navigate to page 6
3. Click on any park
4. View park details
5. Hit browser back button
6. **Result:** Returns to page 6, not page 1

### ✅ Test Case 4: Mobile Sort Dropdown
1. Open Explore page on mobile
2. Tap "Sort by Name" button
3. Select "Sort by State" from dropdown
4. **Result:** Parks immediately sorted by state, dropdown closes

## Files Modified

1. **`/client/src/pages/ExploreParksPage.jsx`**
   - Added sorting logic for server-side pagination
   - Fixed pagination state restoration timing
   - Removed sortBy from filter reset dependencies
   - Enhanced useMemo for currentParks

## User Benefits

1. **Sort by State Now Works:**
   - Works in all scenarios (with/without filters)
   - Immediate visual feedback
   - Maintains current page when sorting

2. **Reliable Pagination:**
   - Never lose your place when exploring parks
   - Back button works as expected
   - URL always reflects current state

3. **Better Mobile Experience:**
   - Sort dropdown works smoothly
   - No unexpected page resets
   - Consistent behavior across devices

## Notes

- Sort changes don't reset pagination (only filter changes do)
- SessionStorage is cleared after use to prevent stale data
- All changes are backward compatible
- Performance optimized with proper useMemo usage
