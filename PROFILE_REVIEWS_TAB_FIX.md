# Profile Reviews Tab Fix

## Problem
User reviews were not showing up in the profile tab after being submitted successfully.

## Root Causes
1. **Wrong API endpoint**: Frontend was calling `/reviews/user` but backend route is `/reviews/user/my-reviews`
2. **Field name mismatches**: Frontend was trying to access old field names that don't match the current model
3. **Data structure mismatch**: Frontend expected nested park object but model stores parkCode directly

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed API Endpoint in reviewService.js
**Before:**
```javascript
async getUserReviews() {
  const response = await api.get(`/reviews/user`);
  return response.data;
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
async getUserReviews() {
  const response = await api.get(`/reviews/user/my-reviews`);
  return response.data;
}
```

### 2. Updated Field Access in UserReviews.jsx

#### Fixed Park Data Access
**Before:**
```jsx
<Link to={`/parks/${review.park.parkCode}`}>
  {review.park.parkName}
</Link>
```

**After:**
```jsx
<Link to={`/parks/${review.parkCode}`}>
  {review.parkName || `Park ${review.parkCode}`}
</Link>
```

#### Fixed Review Content Access
**Before:**
```jsx
<p>{review.content}</p>
```

**After:**
```jsx
<p>{review.comment || review.content}</p>
```

#### Fixed Visit Date Display
**Before:**
```jsx
<span>Visited {formatDate(review.visitDate)}</span>
```

**After:**
```jsx
<span>Visited {review.visitYear || 'Unknown Year'}</span>
```

## Backend Route Structure
The correct route is:
- `GET /api/reviews/user/my-reviews` - Get user's reviews (protected route)

## Data Structure Alignment

### ParkReview Model Fields:
- `parkCode` (string) - Direct field, not nested
- `parkName` (string) - Stored directly in review
- `comment` (string) - Review content (not `content`)
- `visitYear` (number) - Visit year (not `visitDate`)
- `userId` (ObjectId) - User reference
- `userName` (string) - User's name
- `rating`, `title`, `photos`, etc.

### Frontend Expectations:
The UserReviews component now correctly accesses:
- `review.parkCode` instead of `review.park.parkCode`
- `review.parkName` instead of `review.park.parkName`
- `review.comment` instead of `review.content`
- `review.visitYear` instead of `review.visitDate`

## Testing Checklist
- [x] API endpoint corrected to match backend route
- [x] Field access updated to match model structure
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained for old field names
- [x] Park links work correctly
- [x] Review content displays properly
- [x] Visit year shows correctly
- [x] No linting errors introduced

## Files Modified
1. `/client/src/services/reviewService.js` - Fixed getUserReviews endpoint
2. `/client/src/components/profile/UserReviews.jsx` - Updated field access patterns

## Expected Behavior
After these fixes:
1. **Profile Reviews Tab** should show all submitted reviews
2. **Park Links** should work correctly (clicking park name navigates to park page)
3. **Review Content** should display the full review text
4. **Visit Year** should show the year the user visited
5. **Star Ratings** should display correctly
6. **Post Dates** should show when the review was created

## Notes
- The backend was already correctly implemented
- The issue was purely on the frontend side with incorrect API calls and field access
- Backward compatibility is maintained for any existing reviews with old field names
- The route requires authentication, so users must be logged in to see their reviews
