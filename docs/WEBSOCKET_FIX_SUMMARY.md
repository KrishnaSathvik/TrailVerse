# 🔧 WebSocket Real-Time Updates Fix

## ❌ Problem
After the performance optimizations, the favorite heart icon wasn't updating immediately when clicked. Users had to refresh the page to see the change.

## 🔍 Root Cause
The issue was **NOT** with WebSocket - WebSocket was working perfectly! The problem was with **React component reactivity**.

In `ParkDetailPage.jsx`, the `isSaved` state was calculated like this:
```javascript
const isSaved = isParkFavorited(parkCode);
```

This calculation happened **once** when the component rendered. When the `favorites` state updated (via WebSocket or optimistic update), the `isParkFavorited` function would return a new value, but `isSaved` was **not recalculated**.

## ✅ Solution
Wrapped `isSaved` and `isVisited` in `useMemo` to make them reactive:

```javascript
// Before (not reactive)
const isSaved = isParkFavorited(parkCode);
const isVisited = isParkVisited(parkCode);

// After (reactive)
const isSaved = useMemo(() => isParkFavorited(parkCode), [isParkFavorited, parkCode]);
const isVisited = useMemo(() => isParkVisited(parkCode), [isParkVisited, parkCode]);
```

Now, when `favorites` changes:
1. `isParkFavorited` gets a new function reference (due to `useCallback` dependency on `favorites`)
2. `useMemo` detects the change in `isParkFavorited`
3. `isSaved` is recalculated
4. Component re-renders with updated `isSaved` value
5. Heart icon updates immediately! ❤️

## 🧪 How WebSocket Works (Confirmed Working)

### Flow:
1. User clicks heart icon → `addFavorite()` called
2. `addFavorite()` optimistically updates local state
3. API request sent to server
4. Server broadcasts WebSocket event to all connected clients
5. All tabs/devices receive WebSocket event
6. WebSocket event handler updates `favorites` state
7. `useMemo` recalculates `isSaved`
8. UI updates across all tabs!

### Debugging Added (then removed):
- Added extensive logging to trace WebSocket events
- Confirmed WebSocket was working perfectly
- Logs showed events being received and processed
- Issue was with React component not re-rendering

## 📝 Files Changed
1. **`client/src/pages/ParkDetailPage.jsx`**:
   - Added `useMemo` import
   - Wrapped `isSaved` and `isVisited` in `useMemo`

2. **`client/src/hooks/useFavorites.js`**:
   - Cleaned up debug logging

3. **`client/src/services/websocketService.js`**:
   - Cleaned up debug logging

4. **`client/src/hooks/useWebSocket.js`**:
   - Cleaned up debug logging

## 🎯 Result
✅ **Favorite heart icon updates immediately** when clicked  
✅ **Real-time sync works across all tabs**  
✅ **WebSocket events properly trigger UI updates**  
✅ **No page refresh needed**

## 💡 Lesson Learned
When using `useCallback` hooks that depend on state, make sure consuming components use `useMemo` to recalculate derived values when the callback function reference changes. Otherwise, the component won't re-render with the new value.
