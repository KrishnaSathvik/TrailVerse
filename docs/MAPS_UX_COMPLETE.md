## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **1. 🐛 Critical Bug: Dynamic Tailwind Classes**
**The Problem:**
- Category buttons were using `bg-${color}-100` which doesn't work with Tailwind's JIT compiler
- Result: Buttons had **NO STYLING** when active
- Users couldn't tell which category was selected

**The Fix:**
```jsx
// Changed from:
className={`bg-${color}-100 text-${color}-700`}  ❌

// To:
activeStyle: 'bg-orange-100 text-orange-700 border-orange-300'  ✅
```

**Impact:** Category buttons now show beautiful colors:
- 🍽️ Restaurants: Orange styling
- ⛽ Gas: Red styling  
- 🏨 Hotels: Blue styling

---

### **2. 📱 Mobile Responsive Design**

**Search Box Improvements:**
- Reduced wasted space: `top-3 md:top-4`
- Better text sizing: `text-sm md:text-lg`
- Room for buttons: `pr-20 md:pr-24`
- Professional glass effect
- Improved placeholder text

**Category Buttons Improvements:**
- Perfect positioning: `top-[4.5rem] md:top-24`
- Mobile-optimized gap: `gap-1.5 md:gap-2`
- Responsive sizing: `px-3 md:px-4 py-2 md:py-2.5`
- Flexible wrapping: `flex-wrap justify-center`
- Better borders: `border-2`

**Result:** Perfect layout on all screen sizes (360px - 1920px+)
