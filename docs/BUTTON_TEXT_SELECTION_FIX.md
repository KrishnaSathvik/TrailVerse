# Button Text Selection Fix

## Issue
Button text could still be highlighted/selected when clicking and dragging, despite having user-select rules in CSS.

## Root Cause
1. The `<span>` element inside the Button component only had `color: 'inherit'` inline style
2. CSS rules for `a[href]` were too broad and potentially conflicting
3. Inline styles have higher specificity, so CSS rules weren't being applied to the span

## Solution

### 1. Button Component (`Button.jsx`)
Added explicit `userSelect: 'none'` properties to the span element:

```jsx
// BEFORE:
<span style={{ color: 'inherit' }}>{children}</span>

// AFTER:
<span style={{ 
  color: 'inherit',
  userSelect: 'none',
  WebkitUserSelect: 'none',
  MozUserSelect: 'none',
  msUserSelect: 'none'
}}>{children}</span>
```

### 2. Global CSS (`index.css`)
Made anchor tag rules more specific to only target button components:

```css
/* BEFORE: Applied to ALL anchor tags */
a[href], a[data-button-component="true"] {
  user-select: none !important;
}

/* AFTER: Only button-specific anchors */
a[data-button-component="true"] {
  user-select: none !important;
}
```

## Why This Works

1. **Inline Styles**: By adding userSelect directly to the span's inline styles, it has the highest specificity and can't be overridden
2. **Cross-Browser**: Includes all vendor prefixes (webkit, moz, ms)
3. **Targeted**: Only affects button components, not regular text links
4. **Layered Protection**: CSS rules provide backup, inline styles provide guarantee

## Testing

Test by trying to select/highlight text in buttons:
1. Click and drag across button text
2. Triple-click on button
3. Use keyboard selection (Shift + arrows)

**Expected result:** No text selection/highlighting should occur

## Files Modified
- `/client/src/components/common/Button.jsx` - Added userSelect to span
- `/client/src/index.css` - Made anchor rules more specific
