# Park Alerts Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issue
Park alerts from the National Park Service (NPS) were not being displayed on the park details page, even though the backend was fetching and returning them.

## Root Cause
The alerts were being fetched correctly from the NPS API by the backend and included in the `/api/parks/:parkCode/details` endpoint response. However, the frontend `ParkDetailPage` component was:

1. Receiving the alerts data
2. Destructuring them with an underscore prefix (`alerts: _alerts`) indicating they were intentionally unused
3. Not displaying them in the UI - there was no "Alerts" tab in the page

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added AlertTriangle Icon Import
```javascript
import { AlertTriangle } from '@components/icons';
```

### 2. Updated Data Destructuring
Changed from:
```javascript
const { park, campgrounds, activities, alerts: _alerts, visitorCenters: _visitorCenters } = data;
```

To:
```javascript
const { park, campgrounds, activities, alerts, visitorCenters: _visitorCenters } = data;
```

### 3. Added Alerts Tab
Added a new tab to the tabs array:
```javascript
{ id: 'alerts', label: 'Alerts', icon: AlertTriangle }
```

### 4. Created Alerts Tab Content
Added a comprehensive alerts section with:
- **Color-coded severity levels:**
  - Red: Danger/Caution alerts
  - Yellow: Warning alerts
  - Blue: Information/Park Closure alerts
  - Default: Other notices

- **Alert information displayed:**
  - Alert title
  - Category badge (color-coded)
  - Description
  - Link to more information (if available)

- **Empty state:** User-friendly message when no alerts are present

### 5. Added Alert Count Badge
Enhanced the Alerts tab button to show a red badge with the number of active alerts, making it immediately visible when alerts are present.

## Features

### Visual Design
- Color-coded alerts based on severity (Danger, Warning, Information, etc.)
- Category badges for quick identification
- Alert icons for visual consistency
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Matches the existing design system

### User Experience
- Alerts are prominently displayed in their own dedicated tab
- Red badge shows alert count on the tab button for immediate visibility
- Empty state provides helpful message when no alerts exist
- Links to NPS official sources for more details

### Data Flow
```
NPS API → Backend (npsService.getParkAlerts) → 
Backend Controller (getParkDetails) → 
Frontend API (npsApi.getParkDetails) → 
React Query Hook (useParkDetails) → 
ParkDetailPage Component → 
Alerts Tab UI
```

## Alert Categories Supported
- **Danger/Caution** - Red styling (emergency closures, hazardous conditions)
- **Warning** - Yellow styling (potential hazards, advisories)
- **Information** - Blue styling (general information, park updates)
- **Park Closure** - Blue styling (closure information)
- **Other** - Default styling (miscellaneous notices)

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `/client/src/pages/ParkDetailPage.jsx`

### Dependencies
- Uses existing `AlertTriangle` icon from Lucide React (already imported)
- No new packages or dependencies required
- Fully integrated with existing design system

### Cache Configuration
- Alerts are cached for 5 minutes (TTL: 5 * 60 * 1000)
- Short TTL ensures users get fresh alert information
- Backend handles the caching via `npsService`

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with parks that have active alerts:**
   - Yellowstone (fire warnings, road closures)
   - Yosemite (road conditions, seasonal closures)
   - Grand Canyon (weather advisories)

2. **Test with parks without alerts:**
   - Verify empty state displays correctly
   - Confirm no badge appears on Alerts tab

3. **Test alert severity colors:**
   - Verify color coding matches alert categories
   - Check readability in both light/dark modes

4. **Test responsiveness:**
   - Mobile devices (320px width)
   - Tablets (768px width)
   - Desktop (1024px+ width)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Alert Notifications:**
   - Push notifications for new critical alerts
   - Email alerts for favorite parks

2. **Alert Filtering:**
   - Filter by severity
   - Filter by category

3. **Alert History:**
   - View past alerts
   - Track closure history

4. **Smart Alerts:**
   - Highlight new alerts since last visit
   - Show alerts relevant to planned trip dates

## Conclusion
Park alerts are now fully functional and prominently displayed on the park details page. The feature integrates seamlessly with the existing design and provides users with critical, up-to-date information from the National Park Service.
