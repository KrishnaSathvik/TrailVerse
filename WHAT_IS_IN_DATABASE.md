## ❌ NO - NOT IN DATABASE (Correctly Using Alternatives)

### **Park Information:**
```
❌ NOT in database (uses NPS API instead)
├── Park details (name, description, location)
├── Park images
├── Park activities
├── Park amenities
├── Park alerts
└── Park hours/fees

Why? This is GOVERNMENT DATA - should come from official NPS API
Status: ✅ CORRECT approach
```

### **Weather Data:**
```
❌ NOT in database (uses Weather API instead)
├── Current weather
├── Forecasts
├── Temperature
├── Conditions

Why? Real-time data - needs live API
Status: ✅ CORRECT approach
```

### **Static Content:**
```
❌ NOT in database (hard-coded in components)
├── FAQ answers
├── About page content
├── Privacy policy
├── Terms of service
├── Landing page content

Why? Static content that rarely changes
Status: ✅ CORRECT approach
```

### **Temporary Data:**
```
❌ NOT in database (in localStorage temporarily)
├── JWT auth token (session)
├── User object cache (from DB)
├── Unsaved chat state (temp)
├── API response cache (TTL)
├── Cookie consent preferences
└── Analytics session ID

Why? Temporary/cache data - doesn't need persistence
Status: ✅ CORRECT approach
```
