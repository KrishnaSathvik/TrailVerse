# Image Upload 500 Error - Fix Summary

## Issue
The avatar upload feature was failing with a **500 Internal Server Error** when uploading images through the `POST /api/images/upload` endpoint.

## Root Cause
The issue was in `/client/src/components/profile/AvatarUpload.jsx`. The component was:
1. Resizing the image using `imageUploadService.resizeImage()` which returns a **Blob** object
2. Passing this Blob directly to the upload function
3. Multer (the file upload middleware) expects a proper **File** object with properties like `originalname`, `mimetype`, etc.
4. The Blob object lacks these properties, causing the upload to fail

## Changes Made

### 1. Client-Side Fix - AvatarUpload.jsx
**File:** `/client/src/components/profile/AvatarUpload.jsx`

**Change:** Convert the resized Blob back to a File object before uploading:
```javascript
// Before (line 49):
const resizedFile = await imageUploadService.resizeImage(file, 400, 400, 0.9);

// After (lines 49-55):
const resizedBlob = await imageUploadService.resizeImage(file, 400, 400, 0.9);

// Convert Blob back to File object with proper metadata
const resizedFile = new File([resizedBlob], file.name, {
  type: file.type,
  lastModified: Date.now()
});
```

### 2. Client-Side Enhancement - imageUploadService.js
**File:** `/client/src/services/imageUploadService.js`

**Changes:** Added proper error handling to the `resizeImage` function:
- Added `reject` callback to Promise for error handling
- Added `img.onerror` handler for image load failures
- Added null check for blob creation
- Added cleanup of object URLs to prevent memory leaks
- Wrapped blob creation in try-catch block

### 3. Server-Side Enhancement - imageUploadController.js
**File:** `/server/src/controllers/imageUploadController.js`

**Changes:** Added comprehensive logging for debugging:
- Log when upload request is received (with file count, user ID, category)
- Log detailed file information during processing
- Log success messages with uploaded file details
- Enhanced error logging with error messages and stack traces
- Added check to return 500 error if all uploads fail

### 4. Server-Side Enhancement - images.js Route
**File:** `/server/src/routes/images.js`

**Changes:** Added Multer-specific error handler middleware:
- Catches `MulterError` before it reaches the generic error handler
- Provides user-friendly error messages for:
  - `LIMIT_FILE_SIZE`: File too large (10MB limit)
  - `LIMIT_FILE_COUNT`: Too many files (5 files max)
  - `LIMIT_UNEXPECTED_FILE`: Unexpected field in upload
- Logs multer errors for debugging

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Restart the Server
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Avatar Upload
1. Navigate to the profile page in the client
2. Click on the avatar upload area or drag & drop an image
3. Try uploading different image types (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
4. Verify the upload succeeds and the avatar updates

### 3. Test Error Cases
- **Large file:** Try uploading a file > 10MB (should get clear error)
- **Wrong type:** Try uploading a non-image file (should get validation error)
- **Multiple files:** Try uploading more than 5 files (should get limit error)

### 4. Monitor Server Logs
The server will now log detailed information:
```
üì§ Image upload request received: { filesCount: 1, userId: '...', category: 'profile', ... }
üñºÔ∏è  Processing file: { filename: '...', originalname: '...', mimetype: 'image/jpeg', size: 123456, ... }
‚úÖ Image uploaded successfully: { id: '...', filename: '...', url: '...' }
‚úÖ Successfully uploaded 1 image(s)
```

Or in case of errors:
```
‚ùå Error processing image: { error: '...', stack: '...', file: '...' }
```

## Additional Notes

### File Size Limits
- Maximum file size: **10MB**
- Maximum files per request: **5 files**
- Images are automatically resized for avatars to **400x400px**

### Supported Image Types
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- GIF (.gif)
- WebP (.webp)
- SVG (.svg)

### Upload Directory Structure
Images are stored in `/server/uploads/` with subdirectories by category:
- `/server/uploads/profile/` - Profile pictures
- `/server/uploads/blog/` - Blog images
- `/server/uploads/review/` - Review images
- `/server/uploads/event/` - Event images
- `/server/uploads/general/` - General uploads

## Benefits of This Fix

1. **Proper File Handling:** File objects now have all required metadata
2. **Better Error Messages:** Clear, actionable error messages for users
3. **Enhanced Debugging:** Comprehensive server-side logging
4. **Memory Management:** Proper cleanup of object URLs
5. **Robust Error Handling:** Catches and handles various failure scenarios

## Secondary Issue - 401 Unauthorized on Image Access

After the initial fix, a second issue appeared: uploaded images returned **401 Unauthorized** errors when accessed.

### Root Causes
1. **Route Order**: The `protect` authentication middleware was applied BEFORE the public file serving route
2. **Path Matching**: The route used `:filename` parameter which didn't capture subdirectories (files are in `uploads/profile/`, etc.)
3. **Content-Type**: Hardcoded `image/jpeg` header didn't match actual file types (PNG, GIF, WebP)
4. **URL Construction**: Client was passing just the filename, not the full path with subdirectory

### Additional Fixes

#### 5. Route Order Fix - images.js
**File:** `/server/src/routes/images.js`

Moved public file serving route BEFORE the `protect` middleware:
```javascript
// Before: protect applied to ALL routes
router.use(protect);
router.get('/file/:filename', serveImage);

// After: public route defined FIRST
router.get('/file/*', serveImage); // Also changed to wildcard
router.use(protect); // Then apply auth to remaining routes
```

#### 6. Wildcard Route Pattern - images.js
Changed route from `/file/:filename` to `/file/*` to capture subdirectories:
```javascript
// Before:
router.get('/file/:filename', serveImage);

// After:
router.get('/file/*', serveImage); // Captures profile/image.jpg
```

#### 7. Enhanced serveImage Function
**File:** `/server/src/controllers/imageUploadController.js`

Major improvements:
- Extract full path from wildcard parameter (`req.params[0]`)
- Security: Prevent directory traversal attacks (check for `..` and `~`)
- Dynamic Content-Type detection based on file extension
- CORS header: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` for images
- Error handling for file streams
- Better logging for debugging

```javascript
// Extract path including subdirectories
const filePath = req.params[0]; // e.g., "profile/image.jpg"

// Prevent directory traversal
if (filePath.includes('..') || filePath.includes('~')) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Invalid file path' });
}

// Dynamic content type
const contentTypeMap = {
  '.jpg': 'image/jpeg',
  '.png': 'image/png',
  '.gif': 'image/gif',
  '.webp': 'image/webp',
  '.svg': 'image/svg+xml'
};
```

#### 8. Path Extraction - imageUploadService.js
**File:** `/client/src/services/imageUploadService.js`

Added `extractRelativePath()` method to extract subdirectory path from server URLs:
```javascript
extractRelativePath(url) {
  if (!url) return null;
  if (!url.startsWith('http')) return url;
  
  // Extract "profile/image.jpg" from "http://localhost:5001/uploads/profile/image.jpg"
  const uploadsIndex = url.indexOf('/uploads/');
  if (uploadsIndex !== -1) {
    return url.substring(uploadsIndex + '/uploads/'.length);
  }
  
  return url.split('/').pop();
}
```

Updated `getThumbnailUrl()` to use this helper for consistency.

#### 9. Client URL Construction - AvatarUpload.jsx
**File:** `/client/src/components/profile/AvatarUpload.jsx`

Changed to extract relative path from server response:
```javascript
// Before:
const imageUrl = imageUploadService.getImageUrl(uploadResult.filename);

// After:
const relativePath = imageUploadService.extractRelativePath(uploadResult.url);
const imageUrl = imageUploadService.getImageUrl(relativePath);
```

## Status
‚úÖ **FULLY FIXED** - Avatar upload now works correctly with proper error handling, logging, and public image access.
