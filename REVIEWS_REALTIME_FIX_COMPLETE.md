# Reviews Real-Time Sync - Complete Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Cache Invalidation**
Reviews service wasn't invalidating cache on mutations, causing stale data.

### 2. **Missing Delete WebSocket Notification**
Backend didn't send WebSocket event when reviews were deleted.

### 3. **Missing Delete Event Listener**
Client didn't listen for review deletion events.

## What Was Fixed

### Client-Side

#### File: `client/src/services/reviewService.js`

**Added cache invalidation to ALL review mutations:**

```javascript
async createReview(parkCode, reviewData, images) {
  const response = await api.post(`/reviews/${parkCode}`, reviewWithImages, {
    invalidateCache: ['reviews'] // ✅ Clear reviews cache
  });
}

async updateReview(reviewId, reviewData, newImages) {
  const response = await api.put(`/reviews/${reviewId}`, reviewWithImages, {
    invalidateCache: ['reviews'] // ✅ Clear reviews cache
  });
}

async editReview(reviewId, reviewData, newImages) {
  const response = await api.put(`/reviews/${reviewId}`, reviewWithImages, {
    invalidateCache: ['reviews'] // ✅ Clear reviews cache
  });
}

async deleteReview(reviewId) {
  const response = await api.delete(`/reviews/${reviewId}`, {
    invalidateCache: ['reviews'] // ✅ Clear reviews cache
  });
}

async getUserReviews() {
  const response = await api.get(`/reviews/user/my-reviews`, {
    cacheType: 'reviews', // ✅ Use reviews cache type
    skipCache: false
  });
}
```

#### File: `client/src/hooks/useUserReviews.js`

**Added review deletion handler:**

```javascript
// Handle review deleted from another device/tab
const handleReviewDeleted = (data) => {
  console.log('[Real-Time] Review deleted:', data);
  
  // Invalidate EnhancedApi cache
  console.log('[Real-Time] 🔥 Invalidating EnhancedApi cache for reviews');
  cacheService.clearByType('reviews');
  
  // Invalidate React Query to refetch
  queryClient.invalidateQueries(['userReviews']);
};

// Subscribe to WebSocket events
subscribe('reviewAdded', handleReviewAdded);
subscribe('reviewUpdated', handleReviewUpdated);
subscribe('reviewDeleted', handleReviewDeleted);  // ✅ Added
```

#### File: `client/src/services/websocketService.js`

**Added review_deleted event listener:**

```javascript
this.socket.on('review_deleted', (data) => {
  console.log('[WebSocket] Review deleted:', data);
  this.emit('reviewDeleted', data);
});
```

#### File: `client/src/components/profile/UserReviews.jsx`

**Added logging to track updates:**

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const reviews = data?.data || [];
  console.log('[UserReviews] 🔄 Reviews data updated, count:', reviews.length);
}, [data]);
```

### Server-Side

#### File: `server/src/controllers/reviewController.js`

**Added WebSocket notification for review deletion:**

```javascript
await ParkReview.findByIdAndDelete(reviewId);

// Notify via WebSocket
const wsService = req.app.get('wsService');
if (wsService) {
  console.log('[Delete Review] Notifying WebSocket for user:', userId);
  wsService.notifyReviewDeleted(userId, reviewId);  // ✅ Added
}
```

#### File: `server/src/services/websocketService.js`

**Added notifyReviewDeleted method:**

```javascript
notifyReviewDeleted(userId, reviewId) {
  console.log(`[WebSocket] Notifying review deleted for user ${userId}:`, reviewId);
  this.sendToUserChannel(userId, 'reviews', 'review_deleted', { reviewId });
}
```

## How It Works Now

### When You Add a Review:

**Tab A (Park Detail Page):**
1. Submit review form
2. POST `/api/reviews/:parkCode`
3. `invalidateCache: ['reviews']` clears cache in Tab A
4. Backend sends WebSocket `review_added` event

**Tab B (Profile Page):**
1. WebSocket receives `review_added` event
2. `cacheService.clearByType('reviews')` clears cache in Tab B
3. `queryClient.invalidateQueries(['userReviews'])` triggers refetch
4. Fresh review data fetched
5. **Review appears in list within 1 second!** ✓
6. **Review count updates in stats!** ✓

### When You Delete a Review:

**Tab A (Profile Page):**
1. Click delete button
2. DELETE `/api/reviews/:reviewId`
3. `invalidateCache: ['reviews']` clears cache in Tab A
4. Backend sends WebSocket `review_deleted` event

**Tab B (Another Tab):**
1. WebSocket receives `review_deleted` event
2. Cache cleared in Tab B
3. Query invalidated and refetches
4. **Review removed from list!** ✓
5. **Review count decreases!** ✓

### When You Update a Review:

**Tab A:**
1. Edit review
2. PUT `/api/reviews/:reviewId`
3. Cache cleared
4. WebSocket `review_updated` sent

**Tab B:**
1. Receives event
2. Cache cleared
3. Refetches data
4. **Updated review shown!** ✓

## Expected Console Output

### Adding Review (Tab B - Profile Page):

```
✅ [WebSocket] Received review_added event: {parkCode: 'acad', ...}
✅ [Real-Time] Review added: {parkCode: 'acad', ...}
✅ [Real-Time] 🔥 Invalidating EnhancedApi cache for reviews
✅ [CacheService] 🗑️ Clearing cache by type: reviews
✅ [CacheService] ✅ Match found, will delete: reviews:/reviews/user/my-reviews
✅ [EnhancedApi] 🌐 Fetching fresh data [reviews]: /reviews/user/my-reviews
✅ [UserReviews] 🔄 Reviews data updated, count: 5
✅ [ProfilePage] 🔄 Stats recalculated: {reviews: 5, ...}
```

### Deleting Review (Tab B):

```
✅ [WebSocket] Received review_deleted event: {reviewId: '...'}
✅ [Real-Time] Review deleted: {reviewId: '...'}
✅ [Real-Time] 🔥 Invalidating EnhancedApi cache for reviews
✅ [CacheService] 🗑️ Clearing cache by type: reviews
✅ [EnhancedApi] 🌐 Fetching fresh data [reviews]: /reviews/user/my-reviews
✅ [UserReviews] 🔄 Reviews data updated, count: 4
✅ [ProfilePage] 🔄 Stats recalculated: {reviews: 4, ...}
```

## Testing

### Two-Tab Test:

   ✅ [UserReviews] 🔄 Reviews data updated, count: X
   ```
5. **Tab B UI**: Review appears in list! ✓
6. **Tab B Stats**: Review count increases! ✓

### Delete Test:

1. **Tab A**: Profile → Reviews tab
2. **Tab B**: Another tab showing profile
3. **Tab A**: Click delete on a review
4. **Tab B**: Review disappears within 1-2 seconds! ✓
